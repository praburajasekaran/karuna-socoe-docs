Picture a city where morning mist rolls off the Western Ghats, metro rails glide above tree-lined avenues, and a brand-new international terminal awaits your next flight—all without the price tag of Chennai or Bangalore. That city is Coimbatore, and 2025 is its breakout year.

Sales values surged 52 % in the first quarter, metro steel is rising along Avinashi Road, and the airport is quadrupling in size. Yet a river-facing 3BHK with 30+ amenities still costs roughly half its Chennai equivalent. Whether you crave a cooler climate, higher rental yield, or simply a smarter investment, Coimbatore checks every box—and Radiance Realty is ready to welcome you home.

Below are ten compelling reasons to lock in your luxury apartment before the world catches on.
## 1. The Tier-II Sweet Spot  
Coimbatore is no longer a “textile town” — it is a 360-degree economic engine where sales value jumped 52 % in Q1-2025 and unit sales rose 21 % even as bigger metros cooled. Luxury prices here are still 30-40 % below Chennai/Bangalore, giving you head-room for a double-digit appreciation story.  

## 2. Metro in Motion  
Phase-1 of Coimbatore Metro (34.8 km, 2 elevated corridors, ₹10,740 cr) starts civil works in 2025. Once live, commute time from Saravanampatti to the airport drops to 28 minutes — and property values along the corridor historically jump 12-15 % in the first year of operations.  

## 3. Airport 4.0  
A new 75,000 sq m integrated terminal (4× the current size) and a 3,800 m runway will handle 4,200 peak-hour passengers. 605 of 627 acres already handed over — the ribbon-cutting is slated for 2027, pushing peripheral prices northward right now.  

## 4. IT & GCC Boom  
TIDEL Park already offers 9.14 lakh sq ft; the new ELCOT building at Vilankurichi will add 3,000+ jobs in 2025. Demand for an extra 6–7 lakh sq ft of Grade-A space is in the pipeline — that’s a captive tenant pool for your luxury flat.  

## 5. Affordable Luxury — Really  
A river-facing 3BHK with 30+ amenities starts at ₹1.01 crore in Radiance Imperia — the same specification crosses ₹2 crore in Chennai’s OMR. Lower entry, higher delta.

## 6. Climate Capital  
IMD data shows Coimbatore consistently logs below-normal temperature departures and healthier monsoon spreads — meaning lower AC bills and greener views from your balcony.  

## 7. Yields That Beat FDs  
Gross rental yields touch 5.2 % in IT belts like Saravanampatti and Kalapatti, fed by students, medical professionals and GCC employees — a rarity in tier-I cities where yields hover around 3%.  

## 8. Gated, Green, Future-Ready  
Radiance projects feature 30+ amenities — cricket nets, temperature-controlled pools, yoga gardens, EV charging, solar lighting, rainwater harvesting — all wrapped in 24×7 CCTV and biometric access.  

## 9. High-Growth Corridors  
Avinashi Road, Thudiyalur, Kalapatti and Saravanampatti show land scarcity yet robust demand — a classic recipe for accelerated appreciation. Buy now, ride the metro-airport-tech trifecta for the next decade.  

## 10. Transparent, Buyer-Friendly Costs  
Stamp duty is 7 %; registration 4 % (women pay 3 % on properties up to ₹10 lakh). RERA covers all Radiance inventory, and bank subvention schemes from SBI, HDFC & ICICI mean you pay only construction-linked instalments — no hidden surprises.
