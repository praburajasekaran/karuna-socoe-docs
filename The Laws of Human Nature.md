## Journal
- Today is the 4th day, I guess I want to complete the chapter and let's see how it goes.

## Chapter 3
- finished chapter 3 on the masks that others wear and how would wear the right masks for optimal life experience 
## chapter 4: Determine the strength of people's characters
- feels like this chapter is written about me! 
- I think I am mostly like a personalizer type and I'm motivated to apply the lessons in this book for sure because you know, this chapter says that most of your character is inborn from the end age and it is very very difficult to change that. But going on the same project will bring down lots of challenges in life. For example, if I'm a personalizer and take everything personally, it will be very difficult for others to work or even give feedback. So that is a very faulty, disadvantageous portion to lead a good, successful, happy, enjoyable life. So I have to change certain aspects of my not changed, meaning use those aspects in my character, I have to flip them for others benefit. For example, this book says that I have to use my personalizing tendency and become, when I turn towards others, it becomes more of an empathy. And when I cultivate empathy, I have those powers, personalizing powers towards others and it will bring a greater good. Likewise, it lists a lot of toxic types. For example, the perfectionist, the drama magnet, the personalizer, the relentless rebel, there is one character like that. There is a big talker, the sexualizer, the pampered prince or princess, the pleaser, the savior describes all their characters, what they look like, why they are formed, why they are formed in such a way. What are the roots of their behavior? It says all that and also defines who is a superior character. It gives examples of Joan Crawford, a Hollywood actress, who converted all her character flaws into something good for others and became hugely successful. She had about 40 years of a career in Hollywood. I also like the quote at the end. It says that in anything, there is a mistake to think one can perform an action or behave in certain way once and no more. It says that when we do an action once, we are prone to do it one more time and there is no way to prevent that. So it is very, or if you do something, it means that it was done sometime in the past. So it is very, very difficult. So this character formation, habit formation has to be from start. I would like to apply many of these ideas in this chapter to my own purpose and life. I need to do that. And I also got another idea for an app, meaning that will help identify the character fate of someone and how to work with them. How to stay away from them, how to work with them, kind of a personality type character. It will be a fun one to do. This way, you can also analyze people around me. I will just answer a bunch of questions to identify what kind of a person they are, what character type they have. And to learn how to work with them in a productive way or keep my distance from them because they are not like that. So this is what I gained from this chapter. I would like to add a goal to the book, my goal sheet of how I can implement the ideas in this lesson in my life, starting from today.

- Read the chapter on being elusive. Okay, so this chapter taught how to be elusive. 'Elicious' meaning how to see. Basically, it started the story of Coco Roch Chanel, the legendary fashion designer from France. Okay, so her difficult childhood and her journey through her life as a countess. As a countess for someone in France and later she became a fashion designer and launched her own store. How she discovered her path and how she tapped into what is elusive for others. And this opened her career into a grand great way. So I think that's what I guess. So this chapter tells us each of us to be that elusive person. Stop seeking for the difficult and instead flip that around and see what others want. What others are constantly seeking and build that and as a way to build a career.
