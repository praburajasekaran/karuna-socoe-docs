Safe merge
Here's the step-by-step process to safely review and merge the `safe-work-2025-09-25` branch on the other computer:

## 1. First, get the latest changes from remote:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

## 2. Check what branches are available:
```bash
git branch -a
```

## 3. Switch to the safe-work branch:
```bash
git checkout safe-work-2025-09-25
```

## 4. Review the branch thoroughly:
```bash
# See what commits are in this branch
git log --oneline origin/main..safe-work-2025-09-25

# See what files were changed
git diff --name-only origin/main..safe-work-2025-09-25

# Review specific changes (replace with actual file paths)
git diff origin/main..safe-work-2025-09-25 -- src/components/onboarding/Step1Form.tsx
```

## 5. Test the branch locally:
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Run the application
npm run dev

# Run tests if available
npm test
```

## 6. When ready to merge, switch to main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Get latest main
```

## 7. Merge the safe-work branch:
```bash
# Option A: Merge commit (preserves branch history)
git merge safe-work-2025-09-25

# Option B: Squash merge (cleaner history)
git merge --squash safe-work-2025-09-25
git commit -m "Merge safe-work-2025-09-25: [describe changes]"
```

## 8. Push the merged changes:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## 9. Clean up (optional):
```bash
# Delete the feature branch locally
git branch -d safe-work-2025-09-25

# Delete the remote branch
git push origin --delete safe-work-2025-09-25
```

**Important Notes:**
- Always test the branch before merging
- Review all file changes carefully
- Consider running your test suite
- Make sure the merge doesn't break existing functionality
