- Today I had a generally good day. 
	- We went out for lunch with [[Gayathri]]'s family of [[Vasantha Athai]], [[Thirunavukkarasu Mama]], [[Saravanan/Hemnath]], [[Revathy]] and [[Thuriya]]. We went to a restaurant called [[Rajabhogam]] in [[Pallikkaranai]]. The restaurant was crowded, the food good and price reasonable. The bill was around Rs.3,000. It is a non-veg restaurant. 
	- Later, I came home and spoke to my uncle [[Kumar Mama]], he was suggestive of selling our property in [[Chidambaram]]. It is my father's property. It was a 2-hour call. I later discussed about this with [[Gayathri]], and she's more than angry to learn why is uncle more interested in it and that we should not involve anyone in our family matters. She's partly right.

They said the Himalayas couldn’t be tamed.  
So Indian engineers wrote a new story in steel.

CHAPTER 1 – THE WAIT (2003-2017)

Approved in 2003, the project paused for 14 years while engineers redrew every line for terrain, terror-proofing and seismic safety. Active construction finally began January 2017—the same month a daughter in Bhilai asked her father, “Will the bridge really stand?”

CHAPTER 2 – THE STEEL (2017-2021)

Answer: 16,000 tonnes of SAIL  
- 7,511 t plates & chequered sheets  
- 6,690 t TMT rebars  
- 1,793 t structural sections  

All rolled at Bhilai, trucked 1,400 km and lifted 359 m above the Chenab—35 m taller than the Eiffel Tower—into Zone IV earthquake country where winds hit 266 km/h.

CHAPTER 3 – THE MILESTONES  

- Nov 2017 – base supports capped  
- 05 Apr 2021 – 467 m steel arch closed with <3 mm tolerance  
- Mar 2024 – 120-year design-life certificate signed

EPILOGUE – 20 Jun 2025  

First Katra–Srinagar Vande Bharat rolls across; every girder still carries three words: Made by SAIL.

At Kapil Groups we didn’t cast a single beam—but every day we stock, supply and stand behind the same SAIL grades that refused to bend to gravity, weather or 14 years of doubt.  

Need steel that held the sky for two decades?  

Tell us your story—we’ll bring the metal that already wrote its own.

> From the world’s highest rail bridge to the Navy’s fastest frigates—one steel, one nation, one supplier.

- CHENAB BRIDGE – 359 m above the river, 16,000 t of SAIL high-strength plates & rebars, certified for 120-year life and 266 km/h Himalayan winds.  
- FRONTLINE FRIGATES – the same SAIL DMR & HSLA grades armour decks, hulls and bulkheads of Nilgiri-class stealth ships, keeping 300 sailors safe in 40 °C engine rooms and –2 °C Arctic deployments.

Both projects demanded zero-failure steel; both got it from SAIL.  

At Kapil Groups we’ve been stocking, cutting and just-in-time supplying those exact grades since 1962—so your next bridge, turbine or naval module can start build tomorrow, not after a 6-month import wait.

Engineering icons aren’t born—they’re built with steel that refuses to blink.  
Tell us your spec, we’ll bring the metal that already holds up mountains and warships.
