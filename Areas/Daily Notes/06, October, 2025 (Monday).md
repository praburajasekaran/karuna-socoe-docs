- I found this distinction: I'm unable to ask what I want. When my mom goes the extra mile to fulfill the needs of others but simply doesn't care to ask what I want and I'm neglected, I feel jealous of others and I blow up. 
- I want Gayathri to ask my parents on behalf of me, but she's also very naive in her requests. She rarely makes use of any opportunity to ask them what she wants (a bigger house) and says she doesn't want anything. 
- I feel less secure when I don't have anything in our name like a Ration card or gas connection. I feel they still don't recognize as an adult couple who'd need stuff.
