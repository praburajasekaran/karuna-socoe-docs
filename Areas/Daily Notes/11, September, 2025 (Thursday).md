[[What have I learned about myself?]]
- So that I like to be alone by myself. I organize my day so that I don't meet a lot of people, talk to a lot of people and so on.

- Okay, so I spent an excess to my amount of time. So I got this call from my brother regarding website development and have development proposal I had given him months ago. He called out of the blue and asked me whether I can just do the website design for a lower cost. And I got excited by this whole opportunity. I just started cranking and not cranking away setting up the new project folder on cursor and creating some problems to develop the app and the website in one shot. You know what, I spent more than two hours on that. I got excited. But what I got was nowhere near a deliverable. So it was so unplanned. I wanted to say that it was so unplanned and I got carried away. And this is one of the ways I lose track of my time. So I want you to know this about me and add this in a relevant document in my repository so that you know you can give me feedback or give me corrective measures. You know, you can when I ask for some advice or you know, so you know better about me and can advise me accordingly.
- Another thing I noticed about myself was that I tend to spend a waste a lot of time during the day and rush to finish projects at the end of the day or get a very stressed out at night or you know, like that. I am fearing that that might become a fact of my life and I might be at my dead bed and I might feel that I have run out of time and I haven't done much the important things that I had committed. So I will want to change this fix this as soon as possible.
-  So, sometimes I don't have a sense of right and wrong. I endlessly procrastinate and I waste time on trivial things like watching, I've seen videos and stuff like that even during work time. Right? Even when there's a lot of work pending. I don't know how would Robert Green explain that.
