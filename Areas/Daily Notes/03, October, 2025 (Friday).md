Another tip is to use Claude Code inside Cursor. You don't really have to use Cursor itself. If you open Cursor it has a Terminal within it. You can do all the same Terminal commands. Also, Claude Code has a Cursor "app", which you can use instead of the Terminal within Cursor. The beauty of using it within Cursor is that you can more easily open up files and see/read the files alongside Claude Code.
