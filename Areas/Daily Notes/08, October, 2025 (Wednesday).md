- Okay, just a quick journal entry. Okay. So I've been telling, talking to Gayathri about the simple living and the high thinking philosophy. As expounded by Sridhar Vembu of Zoho, that's when I lost patience when she went to the kitchen to give some instructions to the maid. And I lost, when I get, I lose my patience whenever she gets up and thus goes away to do something, no? So that pisses me off and that happened again and then she went there, she disappeared for a couple of minutes and then I was 18, she was not there to do what I want and stuff like that. I know this whole, eye thinking thing went for a toss. It was identical. That's something I will have to fix. I'm also ironically reading the search inside yourself book by shade, man, tang, shade, bang, man, or something like that. I was stitching about how to get a high clarity about all the emotions so that you can have a hold over them. So I was reading that book as well. That's when I lost my patience. Yeah, funny thing!
