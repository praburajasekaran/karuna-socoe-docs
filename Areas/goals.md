# Character Development Goals

## Be consistent... as it is the cornerstone of success

### Empathy Practice

- **Daily**: When someone gives feedback or criticism, pause and ask "How might they be feeling right now?"
- **Goal**: Transform personalizing tendency into understanding others' perspectives
- **Measurement**: Track instances where I successfully receive feedback without taking it personally

### Character Type Observation

- **Daily**: Identify one person's character type using the book's framework
- **Focus**: Look for perfectionist, drama magnet, big talker, pleaser, savior patterns
- **Document**: Note how to work with each type more effectively

### Habit Formation

- **Daily**: Practice one small character-building habit
- **Examples**: 
  - Respond with "Thank you for the feedback" instead of defensive reactions
  - Ask "What can I learn from this?" when facing criticism
  - Practice active listening without immediately relating everything to self

## Medium-term Goals (Next Month)

### 1. Feedback Reception System

  3. Thank the person for their input
  4. Reflect on the feedback privately
  5. Take action on valid points

### 2. Character Analysis App Development
- **Research**: Study existing personality assessment tools
- **Design**: Create questionnaire based on The Laws of Human Nature character types
- **Features**:

## Key Quotes to Remember
> "It is a mistake to think one can perform an action or behave in a certain way once and no more. When we do an action once, we are prone to do it one more time."

> "Character formation, habit formation has to be from start."

## Success Metrics
