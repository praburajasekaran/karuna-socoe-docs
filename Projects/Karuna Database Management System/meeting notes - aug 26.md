# Karuna Database Management System - Meeting Notes

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Client:** [[Prabodh Jain]]

## Database Query Interface

- Prototype at [https://demospaces.com/karunadb/](https://demospaces.com/karunadb/)
- Natural language queries for school searches
- CSV download capability
- Login/authentication system for access control
- Row limits to prevent bulk data extraction

## Current Database Challenges

- 400 schools in Chennai alone
- Contact information changes frequently
- Teachers transfer between schools
- Email addresses update without notification
- Some schools close or merge over time
- 10% database decay over 10 years without updates

## Data Management Requirements

- Entry system for new data
- Edit capabilities for existing records
- Maker-checker approval process
- Activity logging for all changes

## Activity Tracking & Reporting

### Current Issues
- Reports arrive daily via email
- Information scattered across email threads
- No systematic organization or tracking

### Required Tracking Elements
- Training programs attended
- Stories of Compassion participation
- Conference attendance
- Activity reports with mandatory fields:
  - Student participation numbers
  - Karuna prayer recitation
  - Pledge administration
  - Banner display during events

### Milestone Recognition System
- Track schools completing 15, 20, 30+ years
- Automatic alerts for milestone achievements
- Recognition gifts and certificates for long-term participants

## Points-Based Recognition System (Proposed)

- Transparent credit system replacing competitive awards
- Schools earn points for specific activities
- Real-time point tracking visible to schools
- Monthly communication showing current standings

### Point Allocation Examples
- KC number in email subject line: 5 extra points
- Banner display at events: additional points
- Minimum 6 activities per year required
- 100 points annually qualifies for Certificate of Merit

### Performance-Based Rewards
- Recognition for meeting standards rather than beating others
- Mentor club status for 30-year veterans
- Senior clubs train 3 new schools annually
- Collaborative rather than competitive approach
