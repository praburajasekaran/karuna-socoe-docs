**Flow:** Welcome Series - Email 1

**Copy:**
Hi [Name],

Welcome to Yuukke! 

I'm Gokulakrishnan, and I started Yuukke because I was tired of seeing executives lose sleep over corporate gifting logistics.

You know the drill - spreadsheets, address collection, quality control nightmares, and the constant fear of gifts ending up in the trash.

We've helped 500+ companies eliminate these headaches with our turnkey gifting platform.

Ready to see how we can transform your gifting process?

### Day 2 - Problem Agitation (Welcome Flow)
**Subject:** The $50,000 gifting mistake (and how to avoid it)
**Flow:** Welcome Series - Email 2
**Goal:** Agitate the pain points and position Yuukke as the solution

**Copy:**
Hi [Name],

Last month, a client told me about their $50,000 gifting disaster.

They sent 200 "premium" gift baskets to clients. 60% were returned due to poor quality. 30% went to wrong addresses. The remaining 10%? Recipients complained they were "cheap and impersonal."

Sound familiar?

This is exactly why we built Yuukke - to eliminate these expensive mistakes.

Our platform handles everything: quality control, address verification, personalization, and delivery tracking.

No more spreadsheets. No more vendor nightmares. No more brand damage.

The secret? Our curated gift collections + automated logistics.
