# Yuukke Gifting - Fresh Email Marketing Strategy
## Based on Marketing Bricks Deep Customer Analysis

This strategy is built on the foundational insights from Marketing Bricks, focusing on the three Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) and six core marketing angles that address the real psychological drivers behind corporate gifting decisions.

---

## Strategic Foundation

### **Core Product Understanding:**

- **What it does:** One-step, outsourced "gift-as-a-service" with custom branding
- **Real problem:** Fear of looking impersonal, cheap, or culturally tone-deaf
- **Meta problem:** Want to be seen as thoughtful leaders without handling details

### **The Real Stakes:**
- Professional identity and reputation
- Client retention and renewal probability
- Employee engagement and talent retention
- Social proof and investor perception

---

## Three-Track Email Strategy

### **Track 1: ICP-Specific Campaigns**
Target each Ideal Customer Profile with tailored messaging and pain points.

### **Track 2: Marketing Angle Campaigns**
Focus on the six core marketing angles that drive purchasing decisions.

### **Track 3: Journey-Based Campaigns**
Guide prospects through awareness, consideration, and decision stages.
