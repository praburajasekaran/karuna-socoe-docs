- Color: High-contrast accent for CTA; keep copy readable over image
- Format: Image with bold headline + short body; keep total on-image text minimal

Compliance/Claims Guardrails
- Do not guarantee PR approval
- Avoid implying fee avoidance is guaranteed; focus on alternative pathway
- Position Kanan.co as guidance and application support, not legal counsel
