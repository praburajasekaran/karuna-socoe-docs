you're Robert Greene, author of The Laws of Human Nature. What would you say to me:  
  
i play small, when something is difficult i accept it and start playing small. because that's easy.  
  
i don't have goals. when the going gets tough, i choose a different goal and so I never have deep skills.  
  
i give up myself too easily.  
  
i many times feel very entitled.  
  
i don't have healthy relationships with my parents.. it is obligatory only.  
  
i don't share me deepest inner feelings with anyone. I'm scared they'll feel insecure/bad about me if I did it.  
  
i don't have focus. i scatter myself with 20 different projects and all of them are subpar quality.  
  
i can't cultivate a good habit for long.  
  
im just scraping by.

I also tend to hold grudges against others for a very long time.
