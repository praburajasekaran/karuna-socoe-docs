## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Your Brand Needs a Strong Identity**

❌ **Generic Name** - "SNH Cashews" doesn't stand out in B2B or B2C markets  
❌ **No Brand Story** - B2B clients and B2C consumers don't connect emotionally  
❌ **Weak Positioning** - Competing on price, not value in both segments  
❌ **No Visual Identity** - Inconsistent brand presentation across channels  
❌ **Limited Market Appeal** - Name doesn't attract premium B2B clients or B2C consumers  
❌ **No Future-Proofing** - Current name limits expansion into B2C markets  

**The Result: Lost Premium Pricing & Market Share in Both B2B and B2C**
