- So, today, just now I had a call with Gokul and he wanted to start this project immediately. He said that his team will do the integration part, integration with the website quickly. He also wanted to focus on cold mailing because they don't have a list right now. All the leads that they generate are also like junk, meaning that people are not serious about filling this, meaning they haven't been serious and they just fill the form just like that. 
- He also asked for a total cost of the emailing platform, maybe I should give the Apollo scraping cost and the cost of sending via make or something. And the cost of the email mainly the platform. And yeah.
- So it will be like you send emails, cold emails to companies, target audience and then they make them to visit the website, right? And on the website you have a pop-up form to capture their email or opt-in email and this we should have a gifting guide or something, maybe discount and a gifting guide. Yeah, and then you should capture the email and then you start sending them emails once or three meals per week, something like that. It four-mines a week. The variety of information like tips, testimonials, some entertainment, some how-to's, some problems, you talk about their problems, right? So you do that and yeah, so that's the idea. So first I should give them the cost and then the next steps, right? I should make that very, very streamlined.
