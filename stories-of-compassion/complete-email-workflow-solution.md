class EmailNotificationSystem {
    
    public function sendLabelDeliveryEmail($schoolId) {
        // Generate labels for school
        $labels = $this->generateLabels($schoolId);
        
        // Upload to hosting/Google Drive
        $downloadLink = $this->uploadLabels($labels);
        
        // Send email with download link
        $this->sendEmail($schoolId, 'label_delivery', [
            'download_link' => $downloadLink,
            'student_count' => $this->getStudentCount($schoolId)
        ]);
    }
    
    public function sendExamStartNotification($schoolId) {
        $this->sendEmail($schoolId, 'exam_start', [
            'student_count' => $this->getStudentCount($schoolId),
            'exam_start_date' => $this->getExamStartDate()
        ]);
    }
    
    public function sendMidExamUpdate($schoolId) {
        $stats = $this->getParticipationStats($schoolId);
        $this->sendEmail($schoolId, 'mid_exam', $stats);
    }
    
    public function sendFinalDayReminder($schoolId) {
        $stats = $this->getParticipationStats($schoolId);
        $this->sendEmail($schoolId, 'final_day', $stats);
