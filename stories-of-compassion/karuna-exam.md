So, do you hear me?

I'm going to dictate my conversation discussion with my client Prabhojain regarding conducting the stories of compassion, exam using an app or a website.

They used to conduct the exam using Google Forms and doing the scoring is very tedious. About 50 schools participate in the exam and nearly about 15,000 people, students take the exam from 50 schools.

So for the last year's exam just conducted in Namba, the last schools received their exam score only in the end of July. So they want to, this huge delay is not acceptable and they want to optimize this process.

Students pay 20 rupees each student pays 20 rupees to take the exam. The exam services about 10 to 20 stories from the stories of Compassion Book and 30 questions are asked in the exam. And students have a window of seven days during which they can take up the exam. And the passing score is 50 marks 50 percent. And everyone who passes the exam will receive a certificate. This year it will be a Distant Certificate generated automatically.

The teacher, the schools and the teacher would submit the list of students who will participate in the exam. And they will provide their KC number, which is the Karnak lot number, the name of the school, the pin code, the roll number and the name of the student in a spreadsheet. 

So once they provide the name of the submittal list of students who are taking exam, we should send them a list of labels with the exam URL maybe and the date of the exam, the student's, the KC number, the student's name and the role number. And they will use the KC number and the role number to, KC number, the role number and the name to take the exam online in your new system, in our new software.

So once the students take the exam, after the exam window is completed, that is the seven days are completed, we should generate the scores of each student and send a list of scores, passing marks to the respective schools. We have their school's email address that is submitted at the time of our history for this exam. Along with it, we will also create the certificates, that a PDF certificate that the students to the school and the school teacher can distribute the certificates to the student by taking a printout or sending them by WhatsApp, something like that.

So this is the whole process. Right. Okay. And the prices are announced. There will be a first price, second price and third prices for each school. And there will be a price amount, cash price also, which can be distributed among the, if two or more people share the first, second or third prices. This does not fall under the scope of this software exam project.

To log into the exam portal, the student will enter their K.C. number, their name and their role number and there should be a verification process in the back end. And if all these details are correct, the student should take the exam.

I'm not sure if there is a if the exam is has a certain time duration by which they should complete the exam. So this is an unknown. I should ask this to the client.
