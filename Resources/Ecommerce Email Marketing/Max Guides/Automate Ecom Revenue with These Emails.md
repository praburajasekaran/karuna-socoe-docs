| The #1 best part of email marketing is your ability to create email automation that generates revenue for you on autopilot.                                                                                                                                                   |
| I’ve generated $40,000,000 with email flows and I’m going to breakdown everything you need to know in the most concise way possible.                                                                                                                                          |

| ## **Email Marketing Flows**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Flows are the automated emails that you set up once and they’ll start firing automatically based on a customer’s action, such as abandoning a cart.                                                                                                                           |
| Why should you use email flows?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Well, more money. We have some clients that we generate $500k/mo+ just with automated emails.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Flows also contribute to the customer experience via **personalization.**                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Different customers at different parts of the customer journey need different information.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Set up once and **orders will automatically be coming in every day.**                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Any email platform you use will have the ability to set up automations using triggers that fire on your Shopify.                                                                                                                                                              |

| This flow is 4-10 emails set up for when somebody joins your email list. This is debatably the most important flow since it is the customer’s first touchpoint with your brand.                                                                                               |
| One of two things should occur as a result of this flow. Option A is the customer makes their first purchase with your brand. Option B is the customer at least gets all the information they need and objections overcame so that they are primed to buy in the future.      |

| This is just 1 email set up for when someone visits your site but doesn't click any products. There are two reasons someone will enter this flow… they didn’t find a product they liked or they got distracted while browsing your site.                                      |

| This flow of 3-8 emails fires when someone views a product but doesn't end up adding to cart, going to checkout, or buying. There are a number of reasons why, but in most cases it's because they weren't fully bought in on the brand or the product.                       |
| Our purpose of this flow is to get someone farther down the funnel. Get them to go back to the item or find a different product they like more.                                                                                                                               |

| You've probably heard of these flows and for good reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| By not having these properly setup and optimized you are quite literally leaving money on the table from people who were in the process of purchasing.                                                                                                                        |
| However, 90% of the brands I audit don't have a proper Cart Abandon Flow. Most brands only have a Checkout Abandon flow… (go check your trigger and see if it says ‘Checkout Started’ or ‘Added to Cart’)                                                                     |

| #### **Post Purchase Flow**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| This flow will fire right after someone makes a purchase. There are many different directions you can go with this flow… You could focus on community building, upselling / cross selling, getting the customer excited for the order, pushing for a review, etc              |
| I like to keep it simple. Improve the customer experience with a heartfelt thank you, build the community, and then inform them on how to get the most out of their product.                                                                                                  |

| #### **Winback Flow**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| This flow is pretty straightforward, we just want to encourage another purchase from past customers. Your customers here are still receiving email campaigns, sales, and whatever else you're blasting to your list.                                                          |
| We recommend 3-4 email campaigns a week… so 99% of your retention and repeat purchases will come from your campaigns. For this reason, we keep the Winback Flow nice and simple. This is more for customer experience and to at least automated part of the customer journey. |
