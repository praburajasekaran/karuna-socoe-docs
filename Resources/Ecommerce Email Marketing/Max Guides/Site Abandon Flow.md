|## **Site Abandon Flow**|
|We’ve all heard of the cart abandon and browse abandon flows.|
|However, not many people know of the Site Abandon Flow.|
|About 80% of the brands I audit DO NOT have this flow live.|
|It’s the flow sent to someone who **visited your site but didn’t view any products.**|
|Usually, it’s because they didn’t find a product they like OR they got distracted while browsing your site.|
|Say someone sees a social media post of yours and decides to see what you’ve got on your site.|
|While they’re scrolling through your products, their kid spills their cereal on the ground and they have to run and clean it up.|
|We want to be sure to remind them and nudge them to go back to browsing.|

|**Klaviyo Trigger:** Active on Site|
|**Klaviyo Filters (actions that will remove someone from receiving the flow):**|
|- Someone views product at least once since starting this flow.<br>    <br>- Someone adds to cart at least once since starting this flow.<br>    <br>- Somes starts checkout at least once since starting this flow.<br>    <br>- Someone places order at least once since starting this flow.<br>    <br>- Someone has been in this flow at least once in the past 30 days.|

|## **Flow Outline**|
|All you need for this flow is one email.|
|In this email, you just want to remind them that they were browsing and show your bestsellers.|
|You can add more emails such as product highlights, but I wouldn’t add more than a few because the customer will still be receiving your email campaigns.|

|## **Time Delay**|
|The time delay between the action and the email you send is going to vary brand to brand, so be sure to test it out.|
|Typically we find that 4 hours works most often.|
|We usually start testing 1 hour vs 4 hours and take it from there.|
