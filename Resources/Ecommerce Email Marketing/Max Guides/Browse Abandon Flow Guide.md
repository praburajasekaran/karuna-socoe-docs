| Hey it’s Max from The Inbox Newsletter.                                                                                                           |
| One of the most underrated flows is the **Browse Abandon Flow.**                                                                                  |
| This is a large revenue driver for clients, and it’s usually meant for people who are quite skeptical about purchasing.                           |
| Let’s get into it.                                                                                                                                |
| \|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\|                                                                                                                          |
| ## **Purpose**                                                                                                                                    |
| This flow fires when someone **views a product** but doesn't end up adding to cart, going to checkout, or buying.                                 |
| There are a number of reasons why, but in most cases it's because they weren't fully bought in on the brand or the product.                       |
| Our purpose of this flow is to get someone farther down the funnel.                                                                               |
| Get them to go back to the item or find a different product they like more.                                                                       |
| \|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\|                                                                                                                          |
| ## **Flow Layout**                                                                                                                                |
| **Email 1: Simple Reminder**                                                                                                                      |
| Sometimes all we need to get someone to convert is a brief reminder.                                                                              |
| Maybe they got distracted and stepped away from their phone.                                                                                      |
| Or maybe they were on the edge of adding to cart but thought they didn't need it an was waiting for a sign from the universe to pull the trigger… |
| This email serves as their sign.                                                                                                                  |
| [Check out the Email Inspiration of The Day below for a great example]                                                                            |
|                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Email 2: Brand Info and Risk Reversals**                                                                                                        |
| If the customer didn't buy the item, it could be that they don't trust you enough.                                                                |
| Risk reversals and any form of social proof can help get them over the edge.                                                                      |
| Risk reversals are anything that remove risk from the customer's purchase.                                                                        |
| Things like shipping info, guarantees, refunds, social proof, etc are good to include in this email.                                              |
| Even then, maybe the product they browsed isn't the one they like the most, so we want to give them further shopping options.                     |
|                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Email 3: Testimonials**                                                                                                                         |
| The customer STILL may not trust us… so let's nudge them even more.                                                                               |
| Testimonials are the best way to get people to cross the edge and purchase.                                                                       |
| List out a few good ones that will overcome objections in the process.                                                                            |
|                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Email 4: [Optional] Discount Opener**                                                                                                           |
| This email is optional.                                                                                                                           |
| The customer at this point has the necessary social proof to trust you.                                                                           |
| A small offer may be the small nudge they need to make a purchase.                                                                                |
| We want to keep this nice and simple and keep the offer as the main component.                                                                    |
|                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Email 5: [Optional] Discount Closer**                                                                                                           |
| A bit of urgency can do the trick with interested customers.                                                                                      |
| This email will often be the second-best performer behind the initial email.                                                                      |
| Keep it simple!                                                                                                                                   |

| We simply just want to get people further down the funnel.                                                                                        |
| This flow does the trick ;)                                                                                                                       |
