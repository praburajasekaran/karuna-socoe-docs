2024 Ecommerce Trends

More Stores = More Competition

There are new stores popping up every day thanks to Shopify, ease of sourcing products, and the overall low barrier to entry into ecommerce.

And a lot of these new brands are cool, fun, hip, etc.

What this means is that you are not that special.

The consumer has more options to choose from in your niche.

It's becoming increasingly difficult to make sales in a competitive market like ecom.

  

The Consumer Is Shopping Around More and Buying Less

Everybody at this point has been scammed online before. And that has scarred the customer.

Unlike times in the past, **customers today like to do their due diligence.**

The customer also just has less money to spend.

We're also no longer in the 2020-2021 era of stimulus checks and mass spending.

With all the new stores popping up every day, the customer will shop around before spending their precious money.

And it's even **fun** scrolling through Instagram and seeing what other brands are out there.

It's easy for your brand to get caught in the mix.

The Cart Abandon Problem

70% - 85% of Carts Are Abandoned in Ecommerce

This is a staggeringly high rate of abandonment.

70 people out of 100 like your product just enough to add to cart but aren't convinced enough to buy.

There are many possible explanations for this:

- They had an objection
    

- They got distracted
    

- They wanted to come back later
    

And those people will **leave your site and more often than not won't return.**

More than 30% of shoppers plan to buy products in their cart at a later time (but don't)

Many customers aren't looking to buy right this instant.

There isn't enough urgency or convincing on the site to get them to buy now.

Theoretically that doesn't seem like an issue. The customer is planning on coming back.

But the issue is that many **people have terrible memories.**

So they completely forget they added an item to their cart.

**And by the time they remember weeks down the line, they already changed their mind about buying.**

Thus, you lose a lose a sale.

59% of US customers abandon their carts because they are just browsing

The "Add to Cart" button has a new use case.

People in 2024 aren't always treating their cart as a cart.

**They are treating their cart as a "like button".**

Just as someone would "like" a funny cat video on Instagram.

They'll add a few items they like to their cart, continue browsing, and plan to come back to make a decision.

Similar to the prior slide, people have terrible memories and they won't come back.

But there's a bright side to this.

More people today are clicking on their cart and adding items to it.

This gives us more opportunity to send targeted marketing at them.

If you don't, you're burning cash.

26% of shoppers end up buying the abandoned item from a competitor later

The customer likes to shop around.

There are thousands of brands in your niche, why go with the first are second option they see?

Getting somebody to add to cart is no longer a done deal…

But that's only half the battle.

You have to continue to work your leads until they purchase.

Or else they may go to a competitor.

The Problem With Many Cart Abandon Flows

You Don't Actually Have a CART Abandon Flow

Go look right now.

90% of the brands I audit don't have a proper Cart Abandon Flow.

I would bet money that you have a "Cart Abandon Flow" but the trigger is "Checkout Started"

That means it's actually a Checkout Abandon Flow!

Klaviyo's Abandoned Cart flow is incorrect, and **you need to fix it.**

Later in this doc I will show you how to install a proper Added to Cart trigger and flow.

The Flow is Too Short

With only a few emails, you're letting your customer off the hook too soon.

They may forget or go with a competitor.

Extend your flow to **6+ emails across 1-2 weeks time.**

This will improve conversions for a few reasons:

- Multiple reminders makes sure the customer didn't just forget
    

- Allows you to overcome more objections
    

- Stand out from competitors
    

- Gives enough time to make a decision (2 week decision period)
    

The Copy Isn't Effective

We want our copy to be quick and to the point.

The simple fact that you are showing their item that they specifically added to their cart will carry 80% of the sales.

Make sure their item is the #1 feature of the email.

Then, we want to overcome the common objections.

Give them quick info on shipping, the use of the product, customer reviews, etc.

Be sure to answer FAQs and make the decision process as crystal clear as possible.

The Design Isn't Conversion Optimized

Similar to copy, we want the design to be short and sweet.

Get straight to the point and address their item they left behind.

Main aspects you want in your design:

- Clear headline addressing cart or value proposition
    

- Button very high up in the email
    

- Properly show the item left behind with relevant information
    

- Icons or sections with further information

Abandonment Dynamic Content

The most important aspects of an abandonment email is the dynamic content.

This is the content that will change customer to customer and will show exactly what they left behind.

Including your dynamic content will **_drastically_** improve conversions, so make sure you have it right.

They can be a bit difficult to lock in and can vary from store to store.

IMPORTANT: The Abandoned Cart and Abandoned Checkout dynamic sections are different.

Always preview your email with Klaviyo's "Preview" feature to make sure the content is loading in correctly.

How To Optimize Over Time

Why You Should Test

We want to make more money.

Small tests here and there can give you 25-50% revenue boosts here and there that compound over time.

This outline I have given you is only a starting point.

Every brand is different and will require a different optimizations.

Small little alterations will make or break the success of your abandonment flows.

To display the impact of A/B testing here's a list of some recent tests we ran for clients.

  

**Subject line test resulting in nearly 4x in conversions**

  

**Long form vs short form test resulting in 3.5x more conversions**

  

**Alignment test on content resulting in nearly $5k extra in one month**

  

**4 way content test resulting in nearly 2x in revenue**

  

**Product display test resulting in 6x more conversions**

  

**Text based layout test resulting in 40% boost in conversions**

  

**Email content test resulting in 2x the conversion rate**

Important A/B Tests To Run

- Subject lines and preview texts
    

- Time delays between messages
    

- Your offer (Ex. $10 off vs 10% off)
    

- What products are featured in email graphics
    

- Text based emails vs graphic based emails
    

- Long form content vs short form content
    

- Linking to specific products vs collections
    

- Different splits of emails on products
