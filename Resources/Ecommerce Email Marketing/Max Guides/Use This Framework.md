| The problem with many emails is that there is just **way too much going on.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| We need to understand that the customer has a fried attention span.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| The more info you shove in their face, the more overwhelmed they become.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Plus, it’s wasted space and wasted time for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| The customer isn’t to read any email past 50 words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| To add another negative, writing a sales letter with 100+ words will increase sales resistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| When someone opens any of your emails, they KNOW you are trying to sell them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| By going overboard, you make it seem like the only way you CAN make sales is by spending forever trying to justify why the customer should buy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Rather than just simply stating it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| A similar principle can be applied to email design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| If you’re way over the top, you’ll be distracting the customer from your true CTAs and selling points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| The simpler your design is, generally the better your emails perform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Luckily, there is a way to overcome these issues in your email marketing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
