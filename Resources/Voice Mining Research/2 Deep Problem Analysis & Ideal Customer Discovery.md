## Deep Problem Analysis & Ideal Customer Discovery

### Objective

Your task is to uncover the real problem this product solves by thinking 2-3 levels deeper than the surface functionality, then identify all potential ideal customers who experience this deeper problem. You must go beyond what the product obviously does to understand what people actually want when they pay for this solution.

### Core Analysis Framework

### **Step 1:** Uncover the Meta Problem

Before identifying ideal customers, you must first understand the layers of problems this product addresses:

**Surface Problem:** What does the product obviously solve? (the functional layer)

**Underlying Problem:** What frustration or inefficiency drives someone to seek this solution?

**Meta Problem:** What do people really want when they pay for this? What fear, aspiration, or emotional need is driving the purchase decision?

Think about:

- What anxiety, fear, or insecurity does this product help resolve?
- What status, competitive advantage, or transformation does it provide?
- What would happen if someone DIDN'T have this solution? What are they afraid of?
- What future state or identity are they trying to achieve?

### Step 2: Map the Ecosystem of Benefit

Consider everyone who benefits from this product's existence:

- Direct users (who interact with the product)
- Economic buyers (who make purchase decisions)
- Influencers (who recommend or approve)
- Emotional stakeholders (who care about the outcome but don't directly use/buy)

### Step 3: Identify Pain-to-Solution Motivations

For each potential ideal customer, understand their core motivation.

- **Fear based:** what are the afraid of losing, missing or being left behind on
- **Aspiration based:** what future state, identity or competitive advantage do they want
- **Relief based:** what current frustration or inefficiency do they want to eliminate.

## Instructions

- **Start with the meta problem analysis -** dig deep into what people really want
- **Map all potential ideal customers** who experience this deep web problem
- **Focus on emotional drivers and outcomes** rather than demographics.
- **Consider both obvious and non obvious beneficiaries**
- **Think about the decision making ecosystem**, users ≠ buyers ≠ influencers.

## Output format

### The real problem this product solves.

### Ideal Customer Analysis

### Ideal Customer 1: [Descriptive Title]

**Role:** [User/Buyer/Influencer/Stakeholder]

**What They Really Want:** [The deeper outcome/transformation they seek)

**Core Motivation:** [Fear-based/Aspiration-based/Relief-based - what's driving them]

**Why They Pay:** [The emotional or practical reason they would invest in this solution]

### Ideal Customer 2:

[Maximum 3 distinct profiles, focus on the most obvious ]

## Key Reminders

- People buy emotionally and justify logically - focus on the emotional drivers
- The most powerful motivators are often fear-based (fear of loss, being left behind, missing out)
- Consider the entire ecosystem - who else benefits even if they don't directly use the product?
- Think about what happens if they DON'T solve this problem - what's at stake?
- Focus on outcomes and transformations, not features or demographics. The goal is to identify every type of person who would benefit from solving this meta problem, setting the foundation for targeted positioning and messaging.
