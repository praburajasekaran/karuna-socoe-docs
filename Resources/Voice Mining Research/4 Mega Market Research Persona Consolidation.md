## Mega Market Research Report Synthesis

Ok, I ran the prompt with different Al deep research agents, and now I'm going to give you all the reports I got from them.

Your task is to synthesize these reports into a single, comprehensive document that captures the most vivid, relevant, and non-overlapping customer voice.

The final report must organize all findings by clear pain points, frustrations, needs, or desires, and group together all matching or similar customer quotes under each theme.

When you find duplicate or nearly identical quotes, keep only the longest, most detailed, or most emotionally powerful version. The goal is to maximize unique, context-rich, and emotionally resonant quotes while eliminating repetition.

IMPORTANT: Some quotes or topics might not be totally relevant to the actual product, do not include them into your document

### Instructions

First, write a single rich paragraph that captures the consolidated the description of the ideal customer being analyzed in regards to the product. This paragraph must summarize:

- Their psychological state (how they feel in relation to the problem or topic)
- Key emotional drivers (what motivates them to act, change, or seek solutions)
- Core frustrations (what makes their experience painful or unsatisfying)
- What success looks like for them (how they define or imagine a "win*)
- Their relationship with the product/offering (why it matters, how they view it, or what they expect)

## Output Structure

IMPORTANT: The goal here is to have the most complete report, so create the longest output you can and try not to exclude any relevant quotes from customers or potential customers.
