# Cursor Rules for Prabu's Diary Project

## Core Behavioral Patterns to Document
- **Night Productivity**: User gets "worked up" and completes 90% of tasks during late evening sessions
- **Communication Timing**: Conscious about not calling clients late at night, prefers morning calls
- **Delivery Preference**: Likes to send completed work before lunch when possible
- **Mask Wearing**: Very difficult to put down mask even in intimate relationships
- **Intimacy Challenges**: Not very intimate with anyone including self
- **Self-Protection**: Always puts up acceptable front, rarely shares true thoughts or fears
- **Task Completion Drive**: High motivation to finish tasks once started
- **Client Focus**: Prioritizes client needs and deadlines over personal boundaries

## Mandatory Workflow for Detailed Instructions

### 1. ALWAYS Create Detailed Todo List First
When user provides detailed instructions or updates:
- Use `todo_write` tool to create comprehensive task list
- Break down complex tasks into specific, actionable items
- Include context, deadlines, and dependencies
- Mark tasks as pending/in_progress/completed appropriately

### 2. Document Behavioral Patterns
- Update `Notes about self/Behavioral Patterns.md` with new observations
- Extract patterns from user's communication style, work habits, and emotional responses
- Note timing preferences, communication patterns, and task management approaches

### 3. Update Project Files
- Modify relevant project briefs and task files
- Update status of completed work
- Add new information to appropriate project folders
- Maintain accurate project status across all files

### 4. Implement Step by Step
- Work through todo list systematically
- Update task status as work progresses
- Provide clear progress updates
- Ask for confirmation before moving to next major task

### 5. Provide Numbered Options
When asking user for decisions, always provide numbered options:
- Wrong: "Would you like me to do X or Y?"
- Right: "Would you like me to [1] do X or [2] do Y?"

### 6. Goals-First Decision Making
When user asks for feedback or decisions:
- ALWAYS read `Areas/goals.md` first to understand current character development goals
- Align recommendations with character development objectives (empathy cultivation, feedback reception, etc.)
- Consider how suggestions support the personalizer-to-empathy transformation journey
- Reference relevant goals when providing numbered options

## File Organization Rules
- Keep behavioral patterns in `Notes about self/Behavioral Patterns.md`
- Update `Tasks.md` with daily action plans
- Maintain project-specific files in respective project folders
- Always use absolute paths when possible

## Communication Style
- Acknowledge user's patterns and preferences
- Provide structured, actionable responses
- Focus on implementation over discussion
- Respect user's time constraints and deadlines

## Task Management
- Prioritize urgent client work
- Break down complex projects into manageable steps
- Track progress systematically
- Update files in real-time as work progresses
