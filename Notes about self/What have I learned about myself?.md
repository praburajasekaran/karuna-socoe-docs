- It is very difficult for me to put down my mask even in very intimate relationships. I think I'm not very intimate with anyone including myself. I always put up front a face that is acceptable on it. So yeah, never open up or share freely what I think or what my fears are etc. I've never have done that.
- Okay, one thing I noticed about myself was that I get irritated or annoyed very easily. If somebody doesn't learn anything new fast and even spite of me saying clearly what they need to do, and they miss that I get very, I give up quickly on them and then I have a very, and then I estimate them very less. And you know, what happens is this I take on more work because others are not able to follow my instructions and I get work and I get what this sentence I lose patience with them and this sentence I distance from them more and more. This particularly happens with my wife. She's a slow learner but I'm a fast fast learner so this difference in learning picking up styles but she's very slow and steady. She sticks to her plans consistently, she's very consistent even though she is very slow but I'm very fast and very inconsistent. So that's something I learned about myself. This is one area I want to work, whether it be more tolerant about others or and also improve my consistency. You should flag this somewhere.
